# Development of a flexible, modular, and wearable 3D printed sensor system

## Project Overview
This repository present the results of the project of developing a flexible, modular and wearable 3D printed sensor system for the Delsys Inc. Avanti sensors [8]. The goal was to utilize 3D printing technology to create a versatile, adaptable, wearable and portable sensor system. The primary focus is on developing a system that can accommodate EMG sensors for wearable robotics applications, while also being capable of integrating other sensor types. The aim is to produce a sensor system that is both flexible and modular, allowing for easy customization and scalability to meet various research and industry needs. The stated objective of this Research Lab was:
* Acquisition of Electromyography (EMG)-Data in a multi-channel configuration is possible
* Secure and strong fit of multiple Delsys Inc. Avanti sensors [8]
* Wearable below and above the elbow and below and above the knee
* Modular and / or stretchable design to house a variable number of sensors
* No usage of adhesive materials
* Strong fit to dedicated extremities during activities of daily living
* Simple and easy donning and doffing
* Minimum assembly required
* Comfortable fit
